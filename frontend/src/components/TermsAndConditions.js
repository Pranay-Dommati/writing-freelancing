                <ul className="tc-nested-list">
                  <li>Students can post assignments they need help with.</li>
                  <li>Other students can apply to complete assignments and earn money.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                The platform is only meant to connect students in need of help with those willing to assist.
              </li>
              <li>
                The platform is not responsible after students connect with each otherâ€”all further interactions are solely between them.
